👋 Hey, I’m @Malay-exe, your friendly neighborhood coder!<br/>
👀 I’m interested in Python development, AI, and web technologies.<br/>
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques and backend development.<br/>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and innovative AI applications.<br/>
📚 When I’m coding, you’ll find me experimenting with automation or optimizing workflows for fun.<br/>
⚡ Fun fact: I used to challenge myself to complete projects before my laptop battery ran out!<br/>
😎 Bonus fun: If coding were an Olympic sport, I’d be that guy who forgets to submit the code on time but still somehow wins gold.
